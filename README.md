## Description  
The **Financial Goals Tracker** is a user-friendly web application built with React, allowing users to create, manage, and track multiple financial goals. Users can define goals such as a "Travel Fund" or "Emergency Fund," set target amounts, make deposits, and view visual progress.  

The application uses a JSON server hosted on Render to provide full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities. It offers a responsive and clean interface suitable for beginner to mid-level users.

## 🌐 Live API
The JSON server is deployed and accessible at:  
**API URL:** [https://json-server-books-1.onrender.com/goals](https://json-server-books-1.onrender.com/goals)
